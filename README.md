Southwind Farm Game

We have 3 types of agents:
-Farmers.
-Ranchers.
-Pigs.

Farmers are the responsibles of the harvest and they will:
-Plow the land.
-Seed the fields.
-Harvest the crops.
-Store the harvest into the barn.
-Go to sleep when night comes.

Ranchers are the responsibles of the animals and they will:
-Fill the animals feeders.
-Fill the animals drinkers.
-Take the grown animals to the van.
-Go to sleep when night comes.

Pigs will:
-Eat.
-Drink.
-When they grow up they will wait for the rancher to come.
-They will die of starvation if they can't eat/drink
-Go to sleep when night comes.

For this assigment we putted two pigs that wont will grow up
just to maintain the ecosystem and not run out of pigs.

Controls:

-Esc to close the game.
-W/A/S/D & up/down/right/left to move the camera.
-You can buy items in the shop menu, then you can place them 
 using the left click or discard using right click
-Q to add money

# Game

Each item you buy will cost you money and will increase the taxes
you have to pay at the end of the day. Also taxes will increase
as days go by.
If your money is greater than the taxes you can start the next day,
else you will lose.
Selling pigs is the way to get money. If they grow up and have a good
life they will give you money, for te other hand, if they die of starvation
you won't win any money.

# Tips

Buy pigs at the start of the day and they will be ready at the night.
Ranchers are more necessary than farmers because pigs need a lot of attention.
One field generates work for four farmers!
